<h1> about me </h1>

<h3> who I am </h3>

<img src="img/me.jpg" width="200px" title="me circa 2000, eating cake long before my celiac diagnosis...">

<p> My name is Emma, and I'm currently a senior at Harvard University studying computer science with a minor in studio art. When I'm not coding, I work on the design team of <a href="http://theharvardadvocate.com" target="_blank">the harvard advocate</a>, our very old and very loved literary magazine, where I design issue covers and layout. I also am a dj on the record hospital, the underground/punk department of <a href="http://whrb.org" target="_blank">WHRB</a>. Besides DJing, I design posters and other promotional materials for the record hospital's concerts and radio events. Evidence of this can be found under the graphic design section of this site. </p>

<small> a small note: technically my name is "Emily", but circa 2002 (at ~ 7 years old) I decided that "Emma" fit better, and even though I still agree, it's made my life mildly confusing. </small>

<h3> what I like </h3>

<p> In terms of practical computer science, my main areas of interest are currently in operating systems / systems in general. I also think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVlhMGQgDkY" target="_blank">robots are really cool</a>! However, within the past year, I have developed a strong interest in questions of how people use systems tools to promote or hinder accessibilty and justice. For instance, how might a tool used to make black-box machine learning algorithms more human interpretable affect the decisions of a judge, given our propensity to view technological devices as more objective than ourselves? How might byzantine failure in a distributed system that supports a state election cause users to view the democratic process, given their inability to know the validity of the results they see? And how might disadvantaged citizens use privacy/security tools in a meaningful way considering that they are forced to give up some degree of their privacy in order to receive government assistance?  </p>

<h4> work: </h4>

<p style="margin-left: 20px"> 
<b>harvard university</b> <br>
teaching fellow <br> <br>
during the spring 2017 and summer 2017 semesters, I was a teaching fellow (TF) for the class CS1: great ideas in computer science (taught in java). in fall 2017, I was a TF for CS61: systems programming and machine organization (taught in C). as a TF, I am responsible for preparing materials for and holding non-lecture formal instruction. I also hold non-structured extra help hours. these each occur 1-2 times each week. additionally, I frequently check and respond to student questions on the class's <a href="https://piazza.com">piazza</a> board. I love being a TF because it means that I can help motivate students who may be unsure of their interest in computer science to explore it and feel confident in their abilities. 

<p style="margin-left: 20px"> 
<b>cooper hewitt, smithsonian design museum</b> <br>
cross-platform publishing intern during the summer of 2016 <br> <br>
at the cooper hewitt, my main project was to design methods for converting books into web-ready/ebook versions. I worked on figuring out how to get past the issue that the books had been designed only with print in mind, so easier tools did not work effectively on most layouts. using a combination of adobe indesign and python scripts, I was able to make a guide for converting any of the museum's publications into a web-ready version, increasing user accessibilty. <br>
I also designed some postcards and posters for the cooper hewitt's gift shop and for their appearance at the 2016 london design biennale.
