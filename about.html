<h1> about me </h1>

<h3> who I am </h3>

<img src="img/me.jpg" width="200px" title="me circa 2000, eating cake long before my celiac diagnosis...">

<p> My name is Emma, and I'm currently in my third year at Harvard University studying computer science with a minor in studio art. When I'm not coding, I work on the design team of <a href="http://theharvardadvocate.com" target="_blank">the harvard advocate</a>, our very old and very loved literary magazine, where I design issue covers and layout. I also am a dj on the record hospital, the underground/punk department of <a href="http://whrb.org" target="_blank">WHRB</a>. Besides DJing, I design posters and other promotional materials for the record hospital's concerts and radio events. Evidence of this can be found under the graphic design section of this site. </p>

<h3> what I like </h3>

<p> I care a lot about making things work well and look good. My main areas of interest are currently in systems, artificial intelligence, and user experience design. I like design that is both elegant and whimsical when it can be, and I have fun challenging myself to adapt to different styles. I also think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVlhMGQgDkY" target="_blank">robots are really, really cool</a>. </p>

<h3> I don't have a linkedin so I'm just going to list everything I've ever done here: </h3>

<h4> work: </h4>

<p style="margin-left: 20px"> 
<b>cooper hewitt, smithsonian design museum</b> <br>
cross-platform publishing intern during the summer of 2016 <br> <br>
at the cooper hewitt, my main project was to design methods for converting books into web-ready/ebook versions. I worked on figuring out how to get past the issue that the books had been designed only with print in mind, so easier tools did not work effectively on most layouts. using a combination of adobe indesign and python scripts, I was able to make a guide for converting any of the museum's publications into a web-ready version, increasing user accessibilty. <br>
I also designed some postcards and posters for the cooper hewitt's gift shop and for their appearance at the 2016 london design biennale.
