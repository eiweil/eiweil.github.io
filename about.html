<h1> hello </h1>

<img src="img/egg.jpg" height="250px" title="in the montreal biodome!">

<p> I work at the intersection of tech, policy, and equity. for me, this means helping people understand the disparate impact of specific technologies on vulnerable communities and individuals, in order to create better policy. my general philosphy is that unchecked efficiency often furthers the goals of those in power and exacerbates existing inequalities, that transparency without opportunities for shifts in power often works only to convince the public of expert opinion, and that technological responses alone cannot solve social or political problems. </p>

<p> when I decide to not be extremely un-fun, I like punk music and biking and listening to punk music while biking to buy more vegetables to make the same 5 vegan dishes I know how to make. </p>

<b>cooper hewitt, smithsonian design museum</b> <br>
cross-platform publishing intern during the summer of 2016 <br> <br>
at the cooper hewitt, my main project was to design methods for converting books into web-ready/ebook versions. I worked on figuring out how to get past the issue that the books had been designed only with print in mind, so easier tools did not work effectively on most layouts. using a combination of adobe indesign and python scripts, I was able to create a process for converting any of the museum's publications into a web-ready version, increasing user accessibilty. <br>
I also designed some postcards and posters for the cooper hewitt's gift shop and for their appearance at the 2016 london design biennale.
